# PyBer_Analysis
### Overview of the Analysis: 
#### The purpose of the new analysis is to improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for under served neighborhoods, as well as for urban and suburban areas. The analysis will elaborate the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentages of total fares, drivers, and riders by type of city. 

### Results: 
- All figures and charts in "analysis" folder.
#### There are differences between the three types of cities. One of the insights that stood out was the data in (Fig3) which entails the ride fare data. The data showed the fare cost was really high in the rural city, and with that information being delivered (Fig4) shows the amount of drivers in the rural city which is extremely low. In the suburban city the fare data(Fig3) and number of rides(Fig2) did not have much of a high or low impact compared to the urban and rural cities, but in (Fig4) the data shows there's a very low amount of drivers.
